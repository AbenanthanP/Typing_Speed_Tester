# Typing Speed Tester

A polished, dependency-free typing speed test built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Practice typing, track your words-per-minute (WPM) and accuracy in real time, and beat your personal best across four typing modes.

## Overview Of Project

Opening the site drops you straight into a full paragraph of natural text — no splash screen and nothing covering the words. Just start typing; the timer begins with your first keystroke, exactly like MonkeyType.

Each mode is a **separate page with its own link**, so you can bookmark or share any one of them directly:

| Page | Link | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paragraph | [`index.html`](index.html) | Landing page — a full paragraph of natural writing, timed |
| Easy Words | [`easy-words.html`](easy-words.html) | Short, common words for beginners, timed |
| Quotes | [`quotes.html`](quotes.html) | A famous quote; ends when you finish typing it |
| Custom Text | [`custom-text.html`](custom-text.html) | Practice on your own pasted text |
| Results | [`results.html`](results.html) | Graphs and a summary of your latest test |

The nav bar at the top of every page links to all of them, with the current one highlighted via `aria-current="page"`.

As you type, each character is highlighted as correct, incorrect, or "current". Stats (WPM, accuracy, errors, and your best score) update live and are announced to screen readers through an `aria-live` region. When the round ends — time out, or reaching the last character — you are taken to the results page automatically.

## Results page

`results.html` shows the test you just finished:

- **Summary cards** — WPM, accuracy, errors, correct/typed characters, time taken, and your best WPM for that mode, with a "New Best!" badge when you set one.
- **Speed over time** — a line chart of your WPM for each second of the test. Seconds where you made a new mistake are marked with a red ✕.
- **Recent tests** — a bar chart of your last 10 results, with this test highlighted.
- **Try Again** goes back to the mode you just played; **Clear history** wipes the bar chart's past results.

The charts are drawn with the plain Canvas 2D API (no chart library). They redraw sharply on high-DPI screens and when the window is resized, and each canvas has an `aria-label` describing its data for screen readers. With no finished test yet, the page shows a short message and a link to start one.

## Setup

No build step and no dependencies. Open [index.html](index.html) directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Because it is plain static files, it can be hosted as-is on GitHub Pages — each page is then reachable at its own URL (`/`, `/easy-words.html`, `/quotes.html`, `/custom-text.html`, `/results.html`).

## Features

- **Text visible immediately** — the whole passage is rendered on load and scrolls with your cursor as you advance; nothing overlays the words.
- **Four modes, four pages**, each with a real URL and shared styling/logic.
- **Selectable time limits** of 15/30/60/120 seconds on the timed pages, and the passage length scales to match the duration. Your choice is remembered across pages.
- **Quotes and Custom Text count up instead**, ending when you type the final character.
- **Optional 3·2·1 countdown** button for a running start — otherwise typing just begins the round.
- **Live stats**: WPM, accuracy, error count, and your best WPM for that mode.
- **Results page with graphs** of your speed through the test and your recent history.
- **Persistent high scores** per mode in `localStorage`, with a "New Best!" badge and a footer control to reset them. Custom text is saved too, so it is still there on your next visit.
- **Accessible by design**: visible focus outlines, labeled controls, `Esc` to restart, a polite `aria-live` region announcing time/WPM/accuracy each second, and described charts on the results page.
- **Responsive layout** that reflows the nav, controls, and stat cards down to phone width.
- Pasting into the typing box is disabled so results stay honest.

## How scoring works

- Every keystroke is compared against the expected character at that position **the moment it is typed**, and recorded permanently as correct or incorrect. Corrections do not erase history, so backspacing over a mistake and retyping it still counts the original error — accuracy stays meaningful even with heavy editing.
- **Accuracy** = cumulative correct keystrokes ÷ total keystrokes recorded.
- **Errors** = cumulative incorrect keystrokes (including ones you later fixed).
- **WPM** = (currently-correct characters ÷ 5) ÷ minutes elapsed, using the standard "5 characters = 1 word" convention. Elapsed time comes from a wall-clock timestamp rather than timer ticks, so finishing between ticks still scores accurately. This half of the calculation reads the *current* state of your input, so fixing a mistake is reflected in your progress.
- Rounds shorter than two seconds (or under ten characters) never claim the high score, so a one-word custom text cannot leave behind an unbeatable number.

## Project structure

```
index.html         Paragraph mode (landing page)
easy-words.html    Easy Words mode
quotes.html        Quotes mode
custom-text.html   Custom Text mode
results.html       Results page with graphs
style.css          Theming, layout, responsive rules, focus states
script.js          Text banks, shared practice UI, state machine, scoring, storage
results.js         Reads the saved result and draws the canvas charts
```

Each test page is a thin shell: header, nav, a mode description, and an empty `<div id="practice-root">`. `script.js` reads the mode from `<body data-mode="...">` and injects the shared practice UI (controls, stats, typing area) into that root, so the typing interface lives in exactly one place instead of being copy-pasted across four files.

While a test runs, `script.js` records your WPM and error count once per second. When the test ends it saves the full result to `localStorage` (`typingTester.lastResult`), adds a short entry to the last 20 results (`typingTester.history`), and opens `results.html`, where `results.js` reads that data and draws the charts.

`script.js` is organized into labelled sections: text data, mode configuration, the shared UI template, state, storage, text generation, rendering, scoring, round lifecycle (idle → countdown → running → finished), event handlers, and init.

## Future enhancement ideas

- Per-mode *and* per-time-limit high score tracking (best score is currently tracked per mode).
- Hover tooltips on the charts showing the exact value at each second.
- A race mode against a ghost replay of your previous run.
- More text banks: punctuation and numbers drills, code snippets, other languages.
- Exportable or shareable results.
